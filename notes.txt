python versions
- home      3.12.6
- work      3.12.1
- render    3.12.1
- latest    3.13.0

how to start with python venv
- py -m venv .venv
- .venv\Scripts\activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

TODO
- break the python code into smaller files
- make a pass on global and non-local variables

Add style to state and countdown
Move slot hero names to tooltip similar to draft heroes
Do a pass on style, composition and background 
    Try using actual margins instead of the margin divs that you created
Test even longer player and hero names
Improve chat
    Sanitize input in chat or at least for the name command
Add hover and click animations
Add animation to the active team indicaitor
Add sounds
    Button sounds (hover and click)
    Slot sounds (on sitting and leaving)
    Hero ban/pick sounds
    Easter egg: Play "counter pick" if a dibs is picked
Also, reduce volume on all sounds

Don't display controls if hero name is empty
Add a scoll bar to the player list
Add an icon for disconnected players

Add a /reset command


- click sounds
- add a button to name yourself
  o as a relatively simple way to implement this, it could simply add /name to the chat box
- increase the size of player names in teams
- remove hero names from teams
- add tooltips for heroes

it would be nice if clicking on hero controls would not select (or deselect?) hero

ban button is still visible on an already banned hero..
.. i suppose the pick button will be there on already banned or picked heroes, too :(

- hide dibs on the client
- include client_team when downloading home (if possible)
- this might remove the need for the player return from Players.connect

- Fix ban button on banned heroes and potential similar issues with pick button 
- Fix that a click on the ban/pick buttons also select the hero 
- After those two: 
- Add a new post-draft state so that a leaving/reconnecting player cannot mess up the results of a draft or that players cannot change teams before the screen is cleared.
- Add a clear button to the post draft state
- Make the start, cancel and clear buttons replace each other

setting a client team should update all slots to hide or reveal dibs

implement status icons for disconnected players

fix dibs leakage by removing all dibs from initial render
 and the server sending slot updates on team change (including initial team assignment)

unclear how an ended draft is handled and how players are supposed to move around teams after a draft has ended

consider setting player team to observer instead of none
