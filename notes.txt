python versions
- home      3.12.6
- work      3.12.1
- render    3.12.1
- latest    3.13.0

how to start with python venv
- py -m venv .venv
- .venv\Scripts\activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

TODO
- break the python code into smaller files
- make a pass on global and non-local variables

Add style to state and countdown
Move slot hero names to tooltip similar to draft heroes
Do a pass on style, composition and background 
    Try using actual margins instead of the margin divs that you created
Test even longer player and hero names
Add hover and click animations
Add animation to the active team indicaitor
Add sounds
    Button sounds (hover and click)
    Slot sounds (on sitting and leaving)
    Hero ban/pick sounds
    Easter egg: Play "counter pick" if a dibs is picked
Also, reduce volume on all sounds

Don't display controls if hero name is empty
Add a scoll bar to the player list

- click sounds
- add a button to name yourself
  o as a relatively simple way to implement this, it could simply add /name to the chat box
- increase the size of player names in teams
- remove hero names from teams
- add tooltips for heroes

it would be nice if clicking on hero controls would not select (or deselect?) hero

ban button is still visible on an already banned hero..
.. i suppose the pick button will be there on already banned or picked heroes, too :(

- Fix ban button on banned heroes and potential similar issues with pick button 
- Fix that a click on the ban/pick buttons also select the hero 
- Make the start, cancel and clear buttons replace each other

implement status icons for disconnected players

consider if you prefer not value or value is None

add an icon to indicate "you" (bold text is too subtle, especially on the slot)

pause/resume

results has a cooldown
try setting a background to the whole page, maybe something darker
add various sounds
 - last 5 seconds of every countdown
 - various actions using events generated from the server
   o such as client moved to slot/became observer
   o other player moved to slot/became observer
   o hero picked/dibbed/banned
   o dib denied
   o picked hero (with client side queue for overlapping picks)
   o start/cancel/end draft
   o message received, message sent
do away with hero selection
