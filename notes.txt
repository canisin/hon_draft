python versions
- home      3.12.6
- work      3.12.1
- render    3.12.1
- latest    3.13.0

TODO
- break the python code into smaller files
- make a pass on global and non-local variables

Implement the ability to select first ban 
Active team indicators
Implement clever fate
    Fate bans and picks should support one hero of each stat for each team
    Add the ability to select active stats if necessary
Refuse to start draft with no players
Enable/disable buttons on the client based on current state
Add style to state and countdown
Move slot hero names to tooltip similar to draft heroes
Do a pass on style, composition and background 
    Try using actual margins instead of the margin divs that you created
Implement ellipsis or dynamic text size for longer hero and player names
Improve chat
    Implement team chat
    Hide dibs from the opposing team
    Color player names in chat 
    Sanitize input in chat or at least for the name command
Add hover and click animations
Add sounds
    Button sounds (hover and click)
    Countdowns ticks below five seconds
    "ban a hero!"
    Hero pick sounds
    Denied effect for banning? Could grow old very fast
    Sound assets can probably be found in game files

Don't display controls if hero name is empty
Indicate active team by displaying "Banning" or "Picking (n)" next to the team name.
Active team and remaining picks need to be sent to the client. 
  Consider extending state to a little class for this.
It seems that an element can be enlarged by transform: scale( x ) 
  without disrupting the rest of the document!
transform: translate() can probably also be very useful to stack things just right.
Having a single player on the not first banning side skips that player
There seems to be a lobby countdown when draft ends
Reconnecting leaves behind ghost players in teams
