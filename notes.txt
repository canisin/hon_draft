TODO:
- break the python code into smaller files
- convert some loops to more pyhtonic syntax
- make a pass on global and non-local variables

Implement picking 
    Use number of picks to allow picking in any order
    Consider how this might interact with preselected heroes
Implement preselecting heroes
    See if it can also be used for banning
Implement the ability to select first ban 
Active team indicators
Implement clever fate
    Fate bans and picks should support one hero of each stat for each team
    Add the ability to select active stats if necessary
Refuse to start draft with no players
Enable/disable buttons on the client based on current state
Add style to state and countdown
Do a pass on style, composition and background 
    Try using actual margins instead of the margin divs that you created
Implement ellipsis or dynamic text size for longer hero and player names
Improve chat
    Implement team chat
    Color player names in chat 
    Sanitize input in chat or at least for the name command
Add hover and click animations
Add sounds
    Button sounds (hover and click)
    Countdowns ticks below five seconds
    Hero pick sounds
    Denied effect for banning? Could grow old very fast
    Sound assets can probably be found in game files
