- make a pass on global and non-local variables

Implement clever fate
    Fate bans and picks should support one hero of each stat for each team
Refuse to start draft with no players
Enable/disable buttons on the client based on current state
Add style to state and countdown
Move slot hero names to tooltip similar to draft heroes
Do a pass on style, composition and background 
    Try using actual margins instead of the margin divs that you created
Test even longer player and hero names
Improve chat
    Sanitize input in chat or at least for the name command
Add hover and click animations
Add animation to the active team indicaitor
Add sounds
    Button sounds (hover and click)
    Slot sounds (on sitting and leaving)
    "ban a hero!" / "choose wisely!"
    Hero pick sounds
    Easter egg: Play "counter pick" if a dibs is picked

Don't display controls if hero name is empty
Having a single player on the not first banning side skips that player
There seems to be a lobby countdown when draft ends
Reconnecting leaves behind ghost players in teams


"clever fate"
enable/disable buttons on the client
fix reconnecting players
make the current state pretty
general composition
add a lot more sounds
animate the active team indicator
